    description : "After my three-month internship at <a target="_blank" href=\"https://www.id-interactive.fr\">ID Interactive</a>, I stayed
    in the web agency to do a part time job during the school year 2013 - 2014. I worked on two important projects. <br/>
    The first one is an android application which is a social network. You can 
    share some photos based on a theme and the people who posted the most liked photos receive gifts. <br/>
    The second one is a service that allows companies to manage lists of persons to whom they want to send newsletters.
    It's a Mailchimp like application, with a powerful editor as well. It's an angularJS app, relying on a php backend that 
    exposes a REST API."
