    description : "During the 2015 edition of Brest startup week-end,
    I was part of a team working on the project called <a href=\"http://goroadtrip.co\" target=\"_blank\">GoRoadTrip</a>. 
    The goal of this project is quite simple, backpackers can plan their trip or share what they want all
    along their journey. They can meet people who have common interests on a specific place. 
    Then they can share a little bit of their trip together and even save money. <br/> 
    This was my first Startup week-end and it was a great experience. The team spirit in those events is really powerful
    and gives you the desire to continue your projects !"

    description : "Yellow is a school project that I made with my friend <a href=\"http://www.moriniere-boris.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Boris Morinière</a>. 
    The goal of this project is to help people when they play the French game called \"Pétanque\". <br/> 
    In fact, sometimes your eyes are tricking you and you think that the ball is closer than it really is.
    So we tried to get rid of this by making calculations based on a 4 by 4 meters square built aroud the field.
    We used the C++ library <a href=\"http://opencv.org/\">OpenCV</a> to do the image processing. The code is available on <a href=\"http://github.com/clementf/yellow\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>. 
    <br/>The code for the iOS app is written in Swift and we used an Objective-C bridge between Swift and C++ image processing."

    description : "This is a personnal project that I started in late 2013. 
    At this time, I was living in Brest and had a Windows Phone. Unfortunately, there was no app 
    to tell me when the buses were coming. So I tried to reverse engineer the Windows widget of the local bus company.<br/>
    And after this, I could use some of their webservices to get the data in real time. It was quite funny to implement.
    I did it because I was curious about the Windows Phone platform."
